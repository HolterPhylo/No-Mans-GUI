# No-Mans-GUI
A GUI based editor for MBINCompiler

This branch will focus on adding a quest builder, the first of (hopefully) many custom built interfaces to accomplish a specific task.

Should load up all the mission/quest related files at the same time and allow you to just build in an easy to use interface.
